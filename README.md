# Reading Diploma Web Game (Capstone 1)
Repo for the course Capstone Project 1. The project is a web-based reading diploma for youth. The idea is to gamify reading books for the youth and that way, encourage them to read more. The solution should work on mobile and PC and have a responsive design. The teachers on the course provided a direction for our idea and in this project plan document we will explain how we are going to approach the solution. Primary and middle schools could be potential customers for this project.
