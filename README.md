# Reading Diploma Web Game (Capstone 1)
Repo for the course Capstone Project 1. The project is a web-based reading diploma for youth. The idea is to gamify reading books for the youth and that way, encourage them to read more. The solution should work on mobile and PC and have a responsive design. The teachers on the course provided a direction for our idea and in this project plan document we will explain how we are going to approach the solution. Primary and middle schools could be potential customers for this project.  

## Installation & Setup 
>Will be updated as the project progresses

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer and npm
- PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) installed and running
---
### Installation
### Backend
Create a .env file in the root of your backend which contains these parameters
```
# ∨∨∨ REQUIRED ∨∨∨
PORT=3001                                           #<--- Port where the backend will run
DB_PASSWORD=yourPostgresPassword                    #<--- Password set when installing PostgreSQL (password for DB_USER)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=123                                #<--- Required for Google auth, not reavealed publicly!!!
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=123                            #<--- Required for Google auth, not reavealed publicly!!!
SESSION_SECRET=randomlyGeneratedStringOfCharacters  #<--- Generate this yourself (tools below)
# ∧∧∧ REQUIRED ∧∧∧

# ∨∨∨ Required in production environments, to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin to service domain (locally it's http://localhost:3001/)
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3001/

# ∨∨∨ optional ∨∨∨ These values will be set to these defaults if not defined here
NODE_ENV=development                                #<--- Environment mode (development/test/production), set by npm scripts
DB_HOST=localhost                                   #<--- Where the database is hosted, localhost if not defined
DB_PORT=5432                                        #<--- Port where your PostgreSQL database is running (5432 by default)
DB_USER=postgres                                    #<--- PostgreSQL username (postgres by default)
DB_NAME=rdiploma                                    #<--- Name of the database, 'rdiploma' if not defined
UNIT_TEST_DB_NAME=rdiplomatestunit                  #<--- Name of the database used for unit tests, 'rdiplomatestunit' if not defined
INTEGRATION_TEST_DB_NAME=rdiplomatestintegration    #<--- Name of the database used for integration tests, 'rdiplomatestintegration' if not defined
# ∧∧∧ optional ∧∧∧
```

>**IMPORTANT** GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET are used for google authentication can't be uploaded to GitHub, but they will be provided to team members.

You can use the command below to generate the SESSION SECRET for the .env. Generators can be found online as well (e.g. [it-tools.tech/token-generator](https://it-tools.tech/token-generator))
>node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```bash
# Backend installation
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development mode

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
# API calls to /api are proxied to the backend (http://localhost:3001) automatically, via vite.config.js
```

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Backend runs on http://localhost:3001, by default
```
---

### Production mode

**Terminal 2 - Frontend: (Production Build)**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build    # Output in dist/
npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
```

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run start
# Application uses built frontend/dist/
```

## Frontend

The frontend is a React application with an embedded Phaser 3 game, built with Vite.

### Tech Stack
- **React 18** — UI framework
- **Phaser 3** — 2D game engine (renders the interactive maps and reading interface)
- **Vite** — Build tool and dev server

### Routing
The app uses React Router. Users land on a welcome page and choose a role:
- `/` — WelcomePage (role selection)
- `/login/teacher` — Teacher login (email + password)
- `/login/student` — Student login (teacher name + student name + password)
- `/teacher/dashboard` — Teacher dashboard (protected, teacher role only)
- `/game` — Phaser game (protected, student role only)

Auth state is managed by `AuthContext` (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`) which checks the session via `GET /auth/me` on load.

> **Note:** Google OAuth requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `backend/.env` (ask a team member for the values). Once set, teacher login via Google works normally. If you don't have the credentials, use the browser console snippets in the [Testing](#testing-without-google-auth) section instead.

### How It Works
The React app renders a `PhaserGame` component that creates and manages the Phaser game canvas. The game consists of:

- **World Map** — A hub scene with clickable buttons for each continent
- **Continent Maps** — 8 map scenes (Europe, Asia, Africa, Antarctica, Arctic, North America, South America, Oceania) where users follow a path of checkpoints and open books to read
- **Reading Scene** — An overlay that displays book content with scroll-based progress tracking

Game state (reading progress per continent, books read) is managed by a shared singleton in `src/game/state.js`.

### Backend Testing Instructions
The backend has unit and integration tests.

To run tests in the backend use: **npm test**, which runs all tests.

To run only unit tests use: **npm run unit**

To run only integration tests use: **npm run integration**

Unit and integration tests are run in different environments to avoid conflicts.

---
### psql from VSCode terminal (**optional**)
To use psql for database functions (CRUD and data viewing) in the VSCode terminal, add your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin) to system environment Path variables.

Instructions for Windows: [https://commandprompt.com/education/how-to-set-windows-path-for-postgres-tools](https://www.commandprompt.com/education/how-to-set-windows-path-for-postgres-tools/)

**useful psql commands**
- **psql -U postgres** <-- to open psql terminal interface (with the postgres user)
- **psql -U postgres rdiploma** <-- to open the rdiploma database in psql and make requests to it. (e.g. SELECT * FROM books;)
- **\l** <-- to view all databases
- **\dt** <-- to view all tables
- **\q** <-- to close psql
---

### User model

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "john@doe.com",
  "name": "John",
  "password_hash": "asdfasdfjjo1jopjee9fru82ujwarprfaa",
  "avatar": "path/avatar1.jpg",
  "currently_reading": 1,
  "grade": 1,
  "role": "student",
  "teacher_id": 2
}
```

## Testing without Google auth

If you don't have the Google OAuth credentials in your `.env`, you can log in via the browser console instead. Run these snippets at `http://localhost:5173`.

> **Important:** If you get `Unexpected end of JSON input` when running a snippet, it means you already have an active session. Clear it first using **Option B** in the Troubleshooting section (DevTools → Application → Cookies → delete session cookie), then run the snippet again.

**Teacher dashboard:**
```js
fetch('/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ identifier: 'TestTeacher', password: 'Test123!' })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => { console.log(d); window.location.href = '/teacher/dashboard' })
```

**Student dashboard — first create a student via the teacher dashboard, then:**
```js
fetch('/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ identifier: '<student_name>', password: '<student_password>', teacher_name: 'TestTeacher' })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(d => { console.log(d); window.location.href = '/student/dashboard' })
```
Or directly log in through the login page by typing in the student credentials you just created.

## Troubleshooting

### Development phase

**Can't test endpoints using REST client**
- Error: 'Invalid CSRF token': comment out app.use(lusca({...})) for the duration of testing (It creates the csrf token requirement. Applies to all REST clients).
- If using **Thunder client**, after commenting out the lusca part, Error: 'Unauthorized' on every other endpoint except auth/**: reason for this is still unknown, but this problem doesn't appear when using Postman, so consider using that, or another REST client instead.
- **FYI**: The reason for the 'Invalid CSRF token' error is that the X-CSRF-TOKEN header needs to be set on every request, but the value required for it also changes every request and changing it after every request is very tedious, so it's easier to just disable it for the duration of testing. In the frontend the header gets fetched from a cookie or the auth/csrf-token endpoint, before any request.

**Error: 'Invalid CSRF token' on request via frontend/UI**
- post, put, patch or delete fetch request is likely missing X-CSRF-TOKEN header. Add the header according to the instructions at [backend/app.js](https://github.com/Osoito/ReadingDiplomaWebGame_Capstone1/blob/main/backend/app.js) (At the part that says 'Set the X-CSRF-TOKEN header in the frontend like this').

**Error: 'Liian monta pyyntöä. Yritä uudelleen X sekunnin kuluttua.' on request**
- This happens due to request rate limiting applied in [backend/app.js](https://github.com/Osoito/ReadingDiplomaWebGame_Capstone1/blob/main/backend/app.js). Adjust the requests / time window (max/windowMs) accordingly if this error happens during regular application use. This is used to fend off Denial-of-Service attacks.

### Running the application

**Login page redirects straight to `/teacher/dashboard` or `/game`**
- Your browser still holds a session cookie from a previous login. The app correctly treats you as logged in and redirects you.
- **Option A (easiest):** Click the logout button in the Teacher Dashboard or Student game view to clear the session properly.
- **Option B (manual):** Open DevTools (`F12`) → **Application** tab → **Cookies** → `http://localhost:5173` → delete the session cookie entry → refresh the page.
- **Option C (console):** Run this snippet in the browser console to log out programmatically:
  ```js
  fetch('/auth/logout', { method: 'POST' }).then(() => window.location.href = '/')

**Dev server starts on port 5176 (or 5174/5175) instead of 5173**
- Multiple Vite instances are running from previous `npm run dev` calls that weren't stopped.
- Close all terminal windows that were running `npm run dev`, then start a fresh one. Port 5173 will be available again.
- Alternatively, in PowerShell: `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5174,5175,5176 | ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }`

**'Command failed with exit code 1.' when running `npm install` or `npm run db:create` in backend/**
- Create a .env file in **backend/** and add the required fields to it mentioned in the [Installation](https://github.com/Osoito/ReadingDiplomaWebGame_Capstone1?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) part. After that, run `npm install` in **backend/** to install the package and create the required database.

**If migrations (in backend) have been edited**
- run `npx knex migrate:rollback --all` to rollback all migrations, then run `npx knex migrate:latest` to rerun all new migrations

**If new migrations have been added (in backend)**
- run `npx knex migrate:latest` to run all new migrations

**Can't connect to database (Constant internal server errors on requests)**
- On Windows: open services, find postgresql, ensure it says running.
- Ensure you have a .env file in the backend root, which contains the values mentioned above ([Installation](https://github.com/Osoito/ReadingDiplomaWebGame_Capstone1?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)).
- PostgreSQL might not always be running on port:5432 (e.g. if it's already in use). Check which port PostgreSQL is running on. With psql ([psql from VSCode terminal](https://github.com/Osoito/ReadingDiplomaWebGame_Capstone1?tab=readme-ov-file#psql-from-VSCode-terminal-optional)) run:  `psql -h localhost -U postgres`, then run: `SHOW port;` Then update the shown port number to your .env file DB_PORT.
